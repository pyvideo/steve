 ChangeLog

version 0.2 -- in development
=============================

**API Changes**

* **changed steve.util.verify_json to steve.util.verify_video_data**

  The previous function name was a misnomer---it takes a Python
  dict as an argument and has nothing to do with JSON.


**Other Changes**

* **added steve.richardapi**

  Added the richardapi module which has some functions that make
  it easier to do richard API things

* **added steve.util.html_to_markdown**

  Since richard and pyvideo now use Markdown for summaries and
  descriptions, it helps to have a converter.


version 0.1 -- January 13th, 2013
=================================

* **First version, so everything is new.**

  See documentation for features and how to use it!
