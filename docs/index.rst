=======

steve is a command line interface and Python library to make it easy
and fun to add collections of videos to a `richard
<https://github.com/willkg/richard>`_ instance. 

Wait, wut?

It's a bunch of command line subcommands that automate building a
video collection with the basic data and then a library of Python
functions that make it easy to write a script or two to batch-process
a large number of video metadata files.
